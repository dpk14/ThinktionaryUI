## Welcome to Thinktionary

Welcome to Thinktionary, the dictionary for your thoughts!

Traditional journaling mediums–from paper to note apps–may provide an efficient means for storing your thoughts, but not for recalling them.

Once you write something, you have to sift through folders, or remember when you wrote it—or some words it might have contained— in order to find it again. Sometimes, you don’t even remember you wrote something, leaving it effectively lost.

But when you make an entry in your Thinktionary, just add some quick tags to summarize it. Then, you can look up those tags again, revisiting the experience of a combination of emotions, places, people, or ideas through time, observing how your approaches or attitudes toward it have evolved.

With Thinktionary, you can create a chronological database for your:

**Emotions:** Instead of thinking in circles and dealing with the same problems again and again, you can recall how you dealt with an emotion over time, rediscovering and building off past insights. You can create an evolving mental rule book of tactics for dealing with a combination of emotions, or a place or person.

**Memories:** You can tag an entry with people, places, and things, then recall your emotional journey with them, at that place, during that time.

**Notes:** You can record chunks of information, from lecture or meeting notes to shopping lists, then easily rediscover them.

**Ideas:** Sometimes, you’ll think of random, useful bits of information throughout the day. Writing and tagging those thoughts in Thinktionary can help link your scattered, related thoughts through time.

### Support (FAQ)

**How do I save my work?**

You don't! As soon as you start writing an entry, it'll be added to the front of your journal.

**I moved from writing to reading and then back, and my work disappeared!**

As it should! Whenever you move away from the writing screen, your work is saved at the front of your journal, and the writing screen is reset so you can make a new entry. If you want to keep working on that entry, just pull it up in the journal and hit the pencil button.

**How do I remove a tag from an entry I'm writing?**

Go to the "What tags do you want to use?" section on the write screen, then tap the unwanted tag once and it will disappear.

**I just looked up a tag and no entries are showing up! What should I do?**

First of all, don't panic! Make sure that tag is the only one you've selected, and make sure you've cleared the searchbar. If this doesn't work, navigate away from the journal screen and back, then try again.

**I have a question that isn't answered in this FAQ. Where should I go for help?**

If you have any additional questions, reach out to thinktionary.app@gmail.com and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
